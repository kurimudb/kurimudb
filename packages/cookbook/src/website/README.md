This is the front end of the cookbook.

This part has not been open-sourced for the time being, only the built products.

Because:

- It uses an unfinished UI component library in development, Aurora Design, and I don't want to open source the unfinished component library in advance.

- I want to keep the purity of open source, and I don't want some commercial company to simply modify the code and embed the cookbook into their system and sell it.

Although this part of the code is not yet publicly available, you can still use it at will (under the MIT license).
